# Episode 01: Introduction to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Welcome to the first episode of our MARL Foundation Series! This episode introduces the fundamental concepts of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and explores why it represents a paradigm shift from traditional single-agent RL.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Covered

- **The Coordination Problem**: From AlphaStar's dominance in StarCraft II to everyday traffic intersections
- **From MDP to Markov Games**: How joint actions transform the mathematical landscape
- **Nash Equilibrium**: The beautiful paradox where individual rationality meets collective irrationality
- **Non-stationarity**: Why yesterday's perfect strategy becomes tomorrow's failure
- **Exponential Complexity**: The mathematical impossibility of brute-force solutions
- **Emergence**: How simple rules create complex behaviors (Craig Reynolds' flocking to OpenAI's hide-and-seek)
